<p>“You just don’t have the skills to do this. Some people work for years to do this and I just don’t think you have what it takes.”</p>

<p>“You just don’t have the skills to do this. Some people work for years to do this and I just don’t think you have what it takes.”</p>
<p>Not exactly what you want to hear from your boss.</p>
<p>I was early in my pursuit of a career in product management. Looking back, I really didn’t have much of a clue what I was doing. But I wasn’t being equipped and enabled — instead I was told I wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>I walked out of that 1:1 furious.</p>
<p>That experience could have been crushing except for the reframe I decided to take.</p>
<p>I decided to ask myself, <strong>“What can I learn from this?”</strong></p>
<p>I vowed to never limit someone’s potential in my mind. I would take seriously the responsibility of managing others. I also committed to double down on building pm skills so that I could accomplish my future goals.</p>
<p>Reframing can change a miserable experience into something desirable. My friend, Rob Callan, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robcallan_perspective-change-vision-activity-6556524001458470912-JWiQ/">shared his thoughts on LinkedIn</a> about reframing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>How we frame situations matters, especially when we’re doing hard things.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><em>If you’re on a team and you feel enthusiasm stalling for a new project, try focusing instead on what people can learn, achieve, and become — that’s a lot more compelling than focusing exclusively on the tasks themselves.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Many years later I am grateful I took the attitude I did. I’ve been a successful product manager at multiple hyper-growth companies. I run a <a href="https://ryanseamons.substack.com/">weekly newsletter</a> about being a great product leader. And now I enjoy teaching product management as part of what we do with clients at <a href="https://www.sprintwell.com/">Sprintwell</a>.</p>
<p>The biggest piece of advice I give to recent college graduates is to optimize your career for learning. Choose a job where you will learn the most.</p>
<p>For a tough situation at work or in personal relationships, my invitation is to ask, <strong>“What can I learn from this?”</strong></p>
