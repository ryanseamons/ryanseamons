<p>Love the call out around long term, thematic product work that is completely necessary, especially for complex products. That said, everything you described in terms of planning is a part of any solid agile process.</p>
<p>Too often people mistake scrum for agile, where scrum focused on short-term mechanics. When agile is done well you plan for the future, then work on it iteratively. It’s a balance so that you avoid waste — either wasting time planning too little up front (which results in the tetris image you have above) or wasting time planning too much (then things change and your work is thrown out).</p>
<p>Agile, done right, combining mechanics <em>and</em> mindset moves mountains and is great for approaching complex work.</p>
