              Hi. I'm Ryan.
            </p>
            
            <p><span class="font-weight-bold">"What do you <i>really</i> want?"</span> is the central question of my work.</p>
            <p>Product management is the art + science of figuring out and delivering what others want. Are you solving the right problems? Are you investing in the right strategies?</p>
            <p>I make and teach at the intersection of product management, organizational behavior, and learning. The result is a hands-on, experience-based approach to help companies, teams, and individuals find value by answering this critical question through sprints, experimentation, and prototyping.</p>

            <p>I'm the co-founder of <a href="https://sprintwell.com" target="_blank">Sprintwell</a>. Former product manager at LinkedIn, director of product at Degreed, and BYU MBA.</p>
            <p>You can find me on <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/ryanseamons/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanseamons" target="_blank">Twitter</a>.</p>

            <p class="display-6 font-weight-bold mt-10">
              Join me.
            </p>
            
            <p>Each Sunday I send out the free <a href="https://ryanseamons.substack.com/" target="_blank">"What do you really want?" Newsletter</a>. I share ideas that equip readers to help themselves and others clearly answer the question: <i>What do you really want?</i> and concisely communicate that answer to others.             

            <p>Also check out my <a href="articles">latest articles</a> as well as <a href="library">the vault</a>, a curated set of books/videos/articles that I've found most helpful in my personal + professional journey.</p>
